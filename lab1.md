# Microscope Lab

● **Be able to identify the different parts of the microscope**

* **Base** - The bottom portion of the supporting framework and the only part that touches the desk.
* **Arm** - The portion of the supporting framework that sits on the base and supports the stage and body. The arm of our microscopes has an orange handle built into its back.
* **Body** - The body is at the upper end of the arm and contains prisms to direct light from the objectives up through the oculars. The body can pivot so that you can show your partner or your instructor what you are looking at.
* **Oculars** - The ocular lenses are at the top of the pair of binocular tubes on top of the body. You will look through the oculars. Sometimes we will refer to the oculars as eyepieces. These eyepieces magnify images ten times (10X). The right one has a built in pointer. Rotating the outer ring of the eyepiece moves the pointer, but be careful as adjusting the interocular distance also moves the pointer. By moving the mechanical stage and the eyepiece an object can be precisely situated under the pointer tip. This permits you to indicate to another person some particular small object you have seen.
* **Nosepiece** - Below the body is a round nosepiece. Four objective lenses are attached to the nosepiece. Rotate the nosepiece to swing the desired lens into position. The objective will "click" into place when it is properly aligned.
* **Scanning Objective** - The shortest of the four lenses. It has a red colored band around it. It is marked with a 4X, indicating its magnification. This lens has the widest field of view and greatest depth of field of any of the objectives. It should always be used when first locating an object.
* **Low Power Objective** - Marked with a yellow band, this objective magnifies an image 10 times (10X).
* **High Power Objective** - A blue band encircles the sides. It magnifies 40 times (40X).
* **Oil Immersion Objective** - Marked with a white band. Use of this objective requires a drop of special oil between the slide and the lens to reduce light scattering. We will never use this objective in Bio201, but in Bio205 you will use it regularly. It magnifies 100X.
* **Stage** - The large square black platform on which slides or other objects are placed to be studied. The opening near the center allows light to pass from the lamp below through the object being viewed.
* **Mechanical Stage** - A spring loaded clamping device which secures slides. Its two adjusting knobs below the stage allow the clamped slide to be precisely moved right and left, and forward and back, so that the slide can be positioned correctly on the stage.
* **Iris Diaphragm** - This device is attached to the underside of the stage and can be adjusted to control the amount of light passing upward from the lamp. On our Leica microscopes, the iris diaphragm ring is marked with the magnification of the objectives. Rotate the ring of the iris diaphragm so that the magnification of the objective in use faces frontward. If the correct iris diaphragm setting is not in use, there may not be enough light to see details in the specimen or you may see a shadow on the edge of the specimen.
* **Condenser** - A simple lens above the diaphragm and below the stage which focuses light from the lamp onto the slide.
* **Lamp** - The light source for the microscope. These microscopes are equipped with LED lamps. The switch on the right side of the base will turn the lamp on and off. You can adjust the intensity of the light with the light adjustment knob located on the left side of the base. Turn toward you to brighten and away to dim.
* **Coarse Focusing Knob** - These large knobs on either side of the arm near the base are used when focusing. They control the distance between the stage and the bottom of the objectives. A small rotation of this knob produces a noticeable movement of the stage. Use it when focusing the scanning objective.
* **Fine Focusing Knob** - The smaller knobs located lateral to and inside of the coarse adjustment knobs. These are used for precise focusing as is required with the low power, high power and oil immersion objectives. Rotation of this knob produces very slight changes in the height of the stage.

● **Know the four different objective lenses and their power of magnification**

* Scanning objective lens
* Low power objective lens
* High power objective lens
* Oil immersion lens

---

● **Know how to determine the total magnification of any objective lens**

* **Total magnification calculation**

  * Magnification of the ocular multiplied by the magnification of the objective lens = total magnification
  * For example: 10x magnification (ocular) x 4x magnification of the scanning objective lens = 40x total magnification
  * For example: 10x magnification (ocular) x 10x magnification of the low power objective lens = 100x total magnification
  * For example: 10x magnification (ocular) x 40x magnification of the high power objective lens = 400x total magnification

# Mitosis Lab

● **You will need to identify:**

* Prophase
* Metaphase
* Anaphase
* Telophase
* Cleavage furrow
* Spindle fibers

inter- “between”, as in interphase which refers to the stage between cell divisions.

pro- “before” as in prophase, the first stage of mitosis.

meta- “change, after, next”, as in metaphase, the second stage of mitosis.

ana- “up, back, again”, as in anaphase, the third stage of mitosis.

telo- “end, complete”, as in telophase, the final stage of mitosis.

cyto- “cell”, as in cytokinesis, the process of dividing the cytoplasm.

**Interphase:** The stage in the cell cycle where the cell grows and carries out its normal functions. It's divided into G1, S, and G2 phases.

**G1 (first growth) phase:** During this phase, organelles grow and replicate, and the cell conducts its specialized functions.

**S phase (S=synthesis):** DNA replication occurs during this phase, producing copies of all chromosomes.

**G2 phase:** A second period of growth and normal metabolism occurs, where the cell focuses on producing proteins, enzymes, and other molecules needed for mitosis.

**Mitosis:** The process of nuclear division, which is followed by cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm) to create two daughter cells. The stages of mitosis are:

* **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, the nucleoli and nuclear membrane disappear, and the centrioles move to opposite ends of the cell, forming the spindle apparatus.
* **Metaphase:** Chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate (equator) of the cell.
* **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.
* **Telophase:** Chromosomes arrive at the poles, the nuclear membrane reforms, and cytokinesis begins with the formation of a cleavage furrow.
* **Cytokinesis:** The division of the cytoplasm following mitosis.

**Chromosomes:** Structures made of condensed chromatin that carry genetic information.

**Astral Rays:** Microtubules that radiate from the centrioles into the cytoplasm.

**Cleavage Furrow:** A groove that forms in the cell membrane during cytokinesis, eventually pinching the cell into two daughter cells.

**Centrioles:** Organelles that move to opposite poles of the cell during prophase and are involved in forming the spindle apparatus.

**Spindle fibers:** A structure made of microtubules that helps separate chromosomes during mitosis.

## Nervous Tissue

Be able to list the two types of cells that make up nervous tissue

A neuron is a specialized cell in the nervous system responsible for transmitting electrical signals throughout the body.

A multipolar neuron is a specific type of neuron. These neurons are the most common type found in the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord.

The nucleus of a neuron contains the cell's genetic material.

Neurofibrils are bundles of fine fibers found within the neuron, helping to maintain the cell's structure and providing intracellular support for the transport of materials.

Additionally, neuroglia cells (or glial cells) play important roles in supporting, nourishing, and protecting neurons.
